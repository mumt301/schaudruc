            Understanding Digital & Social Media, LLCU 212, has taught me an array of lessons this semester. 
            I now define digital and social media as utilizing the internet and its global community of users to spread a message. 
            Throughout this course I have reflected on the different messages that are sent between users of digital and social media and their impact. 
            Overall, the agendas we have (or perhaps are not aware that we have) are going to present themselves through our interactions on digital and social media platforms. 
            In a sea of billions and in an infinite pool of content, we may think our interactions do not matter, but this course has taught me the importance of my voice online.

        <p id="paragraphTwo">
            I can be a better user of media by being aware of my rights online and helping to cease the spread of fake news. 
            From this class’ discussions and assignments, I have become more aware of my privacy rights online and would like to raise awareness for others as well. 
            I can do this by posting about apps’ terms of service and privacy policies to help users understand who is using their personal information and data and why. 
            Additionally, the problem of fake news has become very worrisome and I plan to go on Twitter to actively call out fake news outlets and posts. 
            By not supporting fake news accounts and calling out those who engage with misinformation and disinformation, I can build a reputable persona online which is increasingly rare these days.
